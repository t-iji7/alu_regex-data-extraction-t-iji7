# Regex Formative Data Extractor
This project is a **Python-based application** that uses **regular expressions (regex)** to extract specified data types from raw text. 
---

## Project Overview

This utility reads a text file (e.g., `sample1.txt`) and scans it using multiple regex patterns to identify and extract:

- **Email addresses**
- **Phone numbers**
- **Time formats** (12-hour & 24-hour) 
- **URLs**  
- **Hashtags**  
- **Currency amounts**    
- **Credit card numbers**  
- **HTML tags**

It supports various valid formats of each pattern (e.g., multiple phone formats, time styles, and card delimiters).

your-project/
├── sample1.txt           # Your input text file containing mixed content
└── filter.py             # Main Python script for extraction
```

## Setup Instructions
- Clone the Repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```
- Create Your Text Sample

- Run the Script
```bash
python filter.py

## How it works
- Opens and reads a text file
- Matches each pattern category found in the text to a specified Regex Pattern
- Outputs each match based on the category
